# Cats and Dogs Classifier
This project is a part of Personal Project

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to classify whether the image is cat or dogs.

### Methods Used
- Convolutional Neural Network

### Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow

## Project Description
This project is create to classify the images of cat or dog, at this project the Data comes from Kaggle Dataset. This project is have accuracy of training at 85% and validation accuracy at 83% after few epochs because at this project,i use callbacks which the lowest accuracy acceptance is 80%.
The goals in this project is how to create a neural network model that can predict or classify the cat or dog image with high accuracy.

## Needs of this project
- Data Augmentation
